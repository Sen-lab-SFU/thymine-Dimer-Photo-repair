# thymine-Dimer-Photo-repair
This is the codebase for data generation and analysis for the investigation of Nucleotide-Mediated thymine Dimer Photo-repair In Duplex DNA.

The paper (LINK HERE) shows a novel method to investigate the effect of flanking bases on the formation and repair of Thymine dimer in duplex DNA.

Guide:

generator.py when run on the data folder will generate a list of files containing the amounts of different Dinucleotide Motifs. 

Analysis.R will generate a set of plots and statistical tests when given formated data for a given range of Dinucleotide Motifs.
